Project that provides information about the climate, made with the intention of putting into practice what I have been learning throughout the studies, I used a free API to provide the necessary information about the climate. I loved doing this project because I was able to deal with many challenging situations, including error handling.

## Learning

I felt very happy with the results I had doing this project, I know it's nothing big or different, but for me what's worth is learning, and that's certainly what I managed to do with this project, it was very good because I put a lot of things I learned in sass and with react in practice, I also know that there is much more to learn, the important thing is to continue studying and learning more and more, and this I will continue to do constantly!!!


## Stack, Libs and Frameworks Used

**Front-end:** [ReactJs](https://pt-br.legacy.reactjs.org/), [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/).


## Documentation, Installation and Informations.

This is a WeatherDay project created using the vite tool, similar to create-react-app, but with its particularities.
- To know more about vite tool and how to install visit its official website. [Vite website.](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Even though it was built with vite, you can use create-react-app, you just have to adapt or copy the code to your work environment and tool that is for your personal use.
- Assuming you have already installed vite or create-react-app, you will have to install the necessary dependencies that the project needs.
- To install them all and see what they are, navigate to the project and see [package.json](https://github.com/dev-erikalves/my-portfolio/blob/main/package.json) e [package-lock.json](https://github.com/dev-erikalves/my-portfolio/blob/main/package-lock.json).
- Also, you may notice that all or most of the files are using shorthand import such as @assets or @components, this was done using vite settings, look at the settings for how it was done in [vite.config.js](https://github.com/dev-erikalves/my-portfolio/blob/main/vite.config.js).
